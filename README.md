# AutoCoffee
Coffee machine turned on at 0640 and 1620 (04:20 pm) using C++ and an Elegoo Uno R3 kit plus coffee maker to replace the need for me in the morning to get up and make station coffee, saving myself sleep as well as automatically refilling coffee for all firefighters


The mechanism is controlled via Blink (an Arduino product) and activates a Servo motor with tape and my fingerprint as the initial motor would run but not trigger the on switch as it is a touch based interface.


Going forward I will be adding a Bluetooth module and using MIT App Inventor to allow for myself to have signal sent from my cell phone for mechanism to trigger.
Add a power source to the Elegoo Kit
Allows me to not have computer connected to the Elegoo kit and prevent spills which would short circuit my laptop.


The Genesis of this project was the desire to use code to have a pragmatic integration within the Internet of Things. 

The result was a program that has positively impacted my life, now as silly as it sounds I have saved 10 minutes to my sleep (pending a call). And 10 minutes to my midafternoon. I definitely want to perform even more task automation.


I incorporated a survey into the project. I verbally asked my colleagues months ago and will be decoumenting their responses as well as using data visualization from Microsoft Forms and format the responses into Power BI or Tableau. Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and Reddit were all used for suggestions as well as I learned much of my C++ practice on Hackerrank. The code review serves as a testing ground for ideas I want to implement, GitHub collaboration hopefully will have a similar collaboratorial effect. 

I am extremely excited to continue to see where this project goes and what other functions can be improved to better the lives of myself and colleagues.
